If the AI is programmed for "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning" title="Reinforcement learning" style="color: rgb(6, 69, 173); ">reinforcement learning</a>", goals can be implicitly induced by rewarding some types of behavior or punishing others.&nbsp;Alternatively, an evolutionary system can induce goals by using a "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_function" title="Fitness function" style="color: rgb(6, 69, 173);">fitness function</a>" to mutate and preferentially replicate high-scoring AI systems, similar to how animals evolved to innately desire certain goals such as finding food.Some AI systems, such as nearest-neighbor, instead of reason by analogy, these systems are not generally given goals, except to the degree that goals are implicit in their training data.&nbsp;Such systems can still be benchmarked if the non-goal system is framed as a system whose "goal" is to accomplish its narrow classification task.</p><p style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; color: rgb(32, 33, 34); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-weight: 400; text-align: start; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">AI often revolves around the use of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms" class="mw-redirect" title="Algorithms" style="color: rgb(6, 69, 173);">algorithms</a>. An algorithm is a set of unambiguous instructions that a mechanical computer can execute.&nbsp;A complex algorithm is often built on top of other, simpler, algorithms. A simple example of an algorithm is the following (optimal for first player) recipe for play at&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe" title="AlphaZero" style="color: rgb(6, 69, 173); ">tic-tac-toe</a>:</p><ol style="color: rgb(32, 33, 34); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-weight: 400; text-align: start; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><li>If someone has a "threat" (that is, two in a row), take the remaining square.

Otherwise,</li><li>take any empty square.</li></ol><p style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; color: rgb(32, 33, 34); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-weight: 400; text-align: start; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Many AI algorithms are capable of learning from data; they can enhance themselves by learning new&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic_(computer_science)" title="Heuristic (computer science)" style="color: rgb(6, 69, 173);">heuristics</a>&nbsp;(strategies, or "rules of thumb", that have worked well in the past), or can themselves write other algorithms. Some of the "learners" described below, including Bayesian networks, decision trees, and nearest-neighbor, could theoretically, (given infinite data, time, and memory) learn to approximate any&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)" title="Function (mathematics)" style="color: rgb(6, 69, 173); ">function</a>, including which combination of mathematical functions would best describe the world.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="line-height: 1; font-size: 11.2px; white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed" style="color: rgb(6, 69, 173);"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (June 2019)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>&nbsp;These learners could therefore derive all possible knowledge, by considering every possible hypothesis and matching them against the data. In practice, it is seldom possible to consider every possibility, because of the phenomenon of "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_explosion" title="Combinatorial explosion" style="color: rgb(6, 69, 173);">combinatorial explosion</a>", where the time needed to solve a problem grows exponentially. Much of AI research involves figuring out how to identify and avoid considering a broad range of possibilities unlikely to be beneficial.&nbsp;For example, when viewing a map and looking for the shortest driving route from&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver" title="Denver" style="color: rgb(6, 69, 173); ">Denver</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City" style="color: rgb(6, 69, 173);">New York</a>&nbsp;in the East, one can in most cases skip looking at any path through&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco" title="San Francisco" style="color: rgb(6, 69, 173);">San Francisco</a>&nbsp;or other areas far to the West; thus, an AI wielding a pathfinding algorithm like&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm" title="A* search algorithm" style="color: rgb(6, 69, 173);">A*</a>&nbsp;can avoid the combinatorial explosion that would ensue if every possible route had to be ponderously considered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; color: rgb(32, 33, 34); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-weight: 400; text-align: start; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">The earliest (and easiest to understand) approach to AI was symbolism (such as formal logic): "If an otherwise healthy adult has a fever, then they may have&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza" title="Influenza" style="color: rgb(6, 69, 173); ">influenza</a>". A second, more general, approach is&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference" title="Bayesian inference" style="color: rgb(6, 69, 173); ">Bayesian inference</a>: "If the current patient has a fever, adjust the probability they have influenza in such-and-such way". The third major approach, extremely popular in routine business AI applications, are analogizers such as&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine" class="mw-redirect" title="Support vector machine" style="color: rgb(6, 69, 173); ">SVM</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbor_algorithm" class="mw-redirect" title="K-nearest neighbor algorithm" style="color: rgb(6, 69, 173); ">nearest-neighbor</a>: "After examining the records of known past patients whose temperature, symptoms, age, and other factors mostly match the current patient, X% of those patients turned out to have influenza". A fourth approach is harder to intuitively understand, but is inspired by how the brain's machinery works: the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network" title="Artificial neural network" style="color: rgb(6, 69, 173); ">artificial neural network</a>&nbsp;approach uses artificial "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurons" class="mw-redirect" title="Neurons" style="color: rgb(6, 69, 173);">neurons</a>" that can learn by comparing itself to the desired output and altering the strengths of the connections between its internal neurons to "reinforce" connections that seemed to be useful. These four main approaches can overlap with each other and with evolutionary systems; for example, neural nets can learn to make inferences, to generalize, and to make analogies. Some systems implicitly or explicitly use multiple of these approaches, alongside many other AI and non-AI algorithms; the best approach is often different depending on the problem.</p><p style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; color: rgb(32, 33, 34); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-weight: 400; text-align: start; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Learning algorithms work on the basis that strategies, algorithms, and inferences that worked well in the past are likely to continue working well in the future. These inferences can be obvious, such as "since the sun rose every morning for the last 10,000 days, it will probably rise tomorrow morning as well". They can be nuanced, such as "X% of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)" title="Family (biology)" style="color: rgb(6, 69, 173); ">families</a>&nbsp;have geographically separate species with color variants, so there is a Y% chance that undiscovered&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory" title="Black swan theory" style="color: rgb(6, 69, 173); ">black swans</a>&nbsp;exist". Learners also work on the basis of "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor#Probability_theory_and_statistics" title="Occam's razor" style="color: rgb(6, 69, 173);">Occam's razor</a>": The simplest theory that explains the data is the likeliest. Therefore, according to Occam's razor principle, a learner must be designed such that it prefers simpler theories to complex theories, except in cases where the complex theory is proven substantially better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; color: rgb(32, 33, 34); font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: 400; text-align: start; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><br>Settling on a bad, overly complex theory gerrymandered to fit all the past training data is known as&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting" title="Overfitting" style="color: rgb(6, 69, 173);">overfitting</a>. Many systems attempt to reduce overfitting by rewarding a theory in accordance with how well it fits the data, but penalizing the theory in accordance with how complex the theory is.&nbsp;Besides classic overfitting, learners can also disappoint by "learning the wrong lesson". A toy example is that an image classifier trained only on pictures of brown horses and black cats might conclude that all brown patches are likely to be horses.</span><span style="font-size: 11px; line-height: 11px; white-space: nowrap;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 14px;">&nbsp;A real-world example is that, unlike humans, current image classifiers often don't primarily make judgments from the spatial relationship between components of the picture, and they learn relationships between pixels that humans are oblivious to, but that still correlate with images of certain types of real objects. Modifying these patterns on a legitimate image can result in "adversarial" images that the system misclassifies.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; color: rgb(32, 33, 34); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-weight: 400; text-align: start; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Compared with humans, existing AI lacks several features of human "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonsense_reasoning" title="Commonsense reasoning" style="color: rgb(6, 69, 173);">commonsense reasoning</a>"; most notably, humans have powerful mechanisms for reasoning about "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Na%C3%AFve_physics" title="Naïve physics" style="color: rgb(6, 69, 173); ">naïve physics</a>" such as space, time, and physical interactions. This enables even young children to easily make inferences like "If I roll this pen off a table, it will fall on the floor". Humans also have a powerful mechanism of "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_psychology" title="Folk psychology" style="color: rgb(6, 69, 173); ">folk psychology</a>" that helps them to interpret natural-language sentences such as "The city councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit because they advocated violence" (A generic AI has difficulty discerning whether the ones alleged to be advocating violence are the councilmen or the demonstrators). This lack of "common knowledge" means that AI often makes different mistakes than humans make, in ways that can seem incomprehensible. For example, existing self-driving cars cannot reason about the location nor the intentions of pedestrians in the exact way that humans do, and instead must use non-human modes of reasoning to avoid accidents.</p></div>
